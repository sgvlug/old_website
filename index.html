  <div class="entry-content"><p>strace: Practical Application Troubleshooting&#8230;<br/>
using the tool we all love to hate.</p>

<p>The Presentation will cover the Linux command line utility &#8216;strace&#8217; and some of it&#8217;s many uses.  It will cover the basics of Linux System Calls and their use.  The presentation will use examples throughout to provide genuine use-cases for the tool.  The Presentation is focused on Practical Application Troubleshooting, it will not be an in-depth guide to the various System Calls.  I will demonstrate many techniques that can help you to gain a deeper understanding of application execution flow on a Linux system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>If you are interested in the group, please sign up for the [SGVHAK mailing list] (http://sgvlug.org/mailman/listinfo/hak &#8220;SGVHAK Mailing List Sign Up&#8221;).  We will continue to crosspost announcements to the SGVLUG mailing list. We are in the process of setting up a website or subpage.</em></p>

<p>Do you like working on hardware projects?  Did you just get a Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Kinect with the intentions of doing something cool?  Did you wish that there was a local meetup group where you can meet up with like-minded folks and actually make progress with your projects?</p>

<p>Come to our kickoff meeting on Thursday to discuss starting up this special interest group.  Connect with your fellow hardware geeks and share some of the projects you&#8217;ve been working on. And if we can decide on a name for the SIG, we can set up things like a mailing list, website, and wiki.</p>

<p>We have been kindly granted access to a room at Caltech for this meeting only.  It is a small classroom with about 30 student desks and a teacher desk.  We will have access to a projector and power.  There is an open wireless network.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its time to face the music: There&#8217;s only a couple guys in Ops, and a
lot of infrastructure to set up and it was all due yesterday. If only
you could clone all the sysadmins of the world to get all of their
expertise and know-how in deploying open source applications, you could
actually get it done. Perhaps there is a way: Juju and Charms! Juju
encapsulates services in a way that promotes sharing and collaboration
the same way packages have done for open source software.  If you are
a sysadmin or a developer who is looking to get an infrastructure of
databases, loadbalancers, and webapps up to speed rapidly, Juju may
be interesting. If you are looking into deploying something massively
scalable, like OpenStack or Hadoop, Juju is built to handle that task.</p>

<p>Speaker: Clint Byrum is a member of the Canonical Ubuntu Server Team, bringing
years of Ops and Development experience in web environments to the task
of making Ubuntu Server shine. <br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The two dominant python-based web frameworks are Django and Pylons. They can be used to deploy web applications such as news sites, online ticket tracking systems, or wikis. An overview and comparison of Django and the recently reinvented Pylons Project will be presented. Individual dependencies of the Pylons Project will be described including the Pyramid WSGI engine, the SQLAlchemy database Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and the Mako HTML template generator. A very simple blog engine will be implemented as an instructive example.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unity is the new desktop environment for Ubuntu, having first premiered in   <br/>
version 11.04, significantly enhanced with version 11.10, and very much the  <br/>
cornerstone of the upcoming 12.04 release.</p>

<p>A striking departure from Gnome 2, Unity has been seen as a source of        <br/>
controversy in the Linux world.</p>

<p>This talk will outline some of the design goals that Unity addresses, noting <br/>
strengths, weaknesses, and improvements across the three versions of Ubuntu in
which it&#8217;s been included.</p>

<p>While Unity offers many usability affordances, some Ubuntu users prefer to   <br/>
customize it for their specific workflows. Linux is famous for its           <br/>
customizability, and Unity is no exception if you know which tools to look   <br/>
for.</p>

<p>This presentation will outline some of the tools available through the Ubuntu<br/>
Software Center to show you how to customize the Unity interface.</p>

<p>Speaker Bio: Richard Gaskin is President of Fourth World, a software design  <br/>
and development consultancy in Los Angeles. Since founding the company in    <br/>
1994, he&#8217;s developed dozens of commercial and open source applications used by
a wide range of organizations, including FedEx, AOL, the US Library of       <br/>
Congress, and hundreds of universities around the world.</p>

<p>Although he started his career with Mac OS, Richard has since delivered      <br/>
applications for Irix, every version of Windows, and has been developing for <br/>
Linux for the last two years.</p>

<p>Richard has spoken at more than a dozen tech conferences, including UbuCon,  <br/>
LiveCode Developer Conference, and MacTech where he had the distinction of   <br/>
being the only presenter using Linux.</p>
