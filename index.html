  <div class="entry-content"><p>JPL&#8217;s Airborne Snow Observatory is an integrated imaging spectrometer and scanning LIDAR for measuring mountain snow albedo, snow depth/snow water equivalent, and ice height (once exposed), led by PI Dr. Tom Painter.  The team recently wrapped our &#8220;Snow On&#8221; campaign where over a course of 3 months, we flew the Tuolumne River Basin, Sierra Nevada, California above the O&#8217;Shaughnessy Dam of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir; focusing initial on the Tuolumne, and then moving to weekly flights over the Uncompahgre Basin, Colorado.</p>

<p>To meet the needs of its customers including Water Resource managers who are keenly interested in Snow melt, the ASO team had to develop and end to end 24 hour latency capability for processing spectrometer and LIDAR data from Level 0 to Level 4 (&#8220;ish&#8221;) products. Fondly referring to these processing campaigns as &#8220;rodeos&#8221; the team rapidly constructed an open source data processing system at minimal cost and risk that not only met our processing demands, but taught the entire team many lessons about remote sensing of snow and dust properties, algorithm integration, the relationship between computer scientists, and snow hydrologist; flight and engineering teams, geographers, and most importantly lessons about camaraderie that will engender highly innovative and rapid data systems development, and quality science products for years to come.</p>

<p>Chris Mattmann is the Compute Lead for the ASO project and he will humbly tell the story of the Compute processing capability on behalf of the larger team, highlighting contributions of its key members along the way</p>

perspectives of developers, tech leads and project managers at a
software development company. Features that will be demonstrated include:</p>

<ul>
<li>User and group management;</li>
<li>Feeds, email notifications and web-to-mail and mail-to-web support;</li>
<li>Per-project role-based permissions,</li>
<li>Time tracking and reports; including calendaring and Gantt charts;</li>
<li>Issue workflow management across multiple roles;</li>
<li>Redmine&#8217;s plug-in architecture and growing developer ecosystem;</li>
<li>Custom fields for extending user accounts, time entries, and other
data structures;</li>
<li>Redmine&#8217;s REST API and how it integrates with third-party platforms.</li>
</ul>


<p>Christefano is one of the founders of Exaltation of Larks, a Drupal
strategy, development and training company; and Droplabs, a coworking
space and classroom near Downtown Los Angeles. As an advocate of open
source software, he helps organize meetups and conferences all over the
Greater Los Angeles Area. In his spare time, he trains as an amateur
acrobat and gymnast at the Original Muscle Beach in Santa Monica.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are building the Internet-in-a-Box - A small, inexpensive device which
provides essential Internet resources without any Internet connection.  It
provides a local copy of half a terabyte of the world&#8217;s Free information.</p>

<p>The device includes Wikipedia in a dozen languages, a library of 40,000
e-books, most of the world&#8217;s open source software and source code, hundreds of
hours of instructional videos, and world-wide mapping down to street level.</p>

<p>We can deploy a &#8220;knowledge hotspot&#8221; anywhere in the world - even under solar
power.</p>

<p>This Open Source project is being developed by SGVLUG and SGVHAK
members.</p>
