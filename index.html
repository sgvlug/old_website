  <div class="entry-content"><p>Christefano Reyes presents on Redmine, a free and open source project
management and issue tracking system written in Ruby on Rails. Prior to
this presentation, attendees are welcome and encouraged to
<a href="http://www.redmine.org">download it</a>, use a
<a href="http://demo.redmine.org">shared demo</a>
or try a private, <a href="http://www.webenabled.com">one-click install</a>.</p>

<p>Popular with (but certainly not limited to) the Ruby on Rails developer
community, Redmine is a full-featured system used by companies, open
source projects, governmental agencies, and individual developers around
the world. Big users of Redmine include open source projects such as
Ruby, Puppet, Gentoo, Lighttpd, TYPO3, and the Redmine project itself.</p>

<p>This presentation will focus on how Redmine is used from the
perspectives of developers, tech leads and project managers at a
software development company. Features that will be demonstrated include:</p>

<ul>
<li>User and group management;</li>
<li>Feeds, email notifications and web-to-mail and mail-to-web support;</li>
<li>Per-project role-based permissions,</li>
<li>Time tracking and reports; including calendaring and Gantt charts;</li>
<li>Issue workflow management across multiple roles;</li>
<li>Redmine&#8217;s plug-in architecture and growing developer ecosystem;</li>
<li>Custom fields for extending user accounts, time entries, and other
data structures;</li>
<li>Redmine&#8217;s REST API and how it integrates with third-party platforms.</li>
</ul>


<p>Christefano is one of the founders of Exaltation of Larks, a Drupal
strategy, development and training company; and Droplabs, a coworking

<p><strong><em>Please note that we are in a different room this month. Signs will be posted, but please check out the directions given under Location:</em></strong></p>

<p>A modern day Linux Infrastructure should be flexible, scalable and able to deal
with the constant changes any business will require.  Automation is key to a
reliable and consistence server infrastructure, Automation also allows for easy
integration of new changes.</p>

<p>The DevOps movement melds two traditionally siloed teams; Application
Developers and Operations Engineers.  Writing infrastructure as code presents a
number of challenges and potential pitfalls, Operations Engineers need to write
code (something they may not be familar with) and Developers need to have a
strong understanding of the system (many Developers don&#8217;t want to be considered
with anything other than web applications).  There are several major projects
related purely to the management of infrastructure as code.</p>

<p>We will examine Opscode Chef and make a strong use case for the implementation
of Opscode Chef in a Linux Environment.  David will demonstrate many techniques
to utilize Chef quickly and efficiently to minimize the time of implementation.
Although Opscode Chef can be run on Solaris, FreeBSD and even Windows, the
presentation will discuss Linux and only Linux.  David will also discuss the
techniques to operate Chef on various Linux Distros which can provide a layer
of abstraction from the package management systems (apt &amp; yum).  Finally David
will discuss how Chef can be used to rebuild an Entire infrastructure
(regardless of size or complexity) in a time previous thought impossible.  The
only limitation in speed of deployment is the hardware.</p>

Location: Caltech - Lauritsen 269.  Lauritsen is connected to Downs; the room is a lecture hall on the 2nd floor towards northeast end. The buildings are located across from the tennis courts on California at Arden. If you enter near our usual room (Downs 107),  go down the hallway, hang a right, go past the elevators, and take the stairs up one level.  As soon as you come out on the 2nd floor, the classroom is on the left hand side.  If you take the elevator, you will want to head left after getting off the elevator.  (There is a map taped next to elevator on the 2nd floor that shows the layout of Lauritsen.)</p>
