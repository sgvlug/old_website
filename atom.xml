Big thanks to Dmitriy and Tom for being willing to put together a presentation for us on short notice.   Cookies have been promised.</font></em></p>

<p>Tom and Dmitriy will present on how they use open source tools at JPL in their line of work.
These tools include: Raspi, GStreamer, Mercurial/Trac, Wireshark, vi, and others.</p>

<p>BIO:
Dmitriy Bekker and Thomas Werne are currently staff engineers in the Instrument Flight and GSE Software group in the Instrument Electronics and Sensors Section at JPL. They are working on FPGA-based data acquisition and processing designs for multiple prototype science instruments for ground, space, and airborne applications as well as technology development for small satellites. Their projects have been deployed to the Mojave Desert, on high altitude aircraft, at observatories, and on CubeSats.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Christefano Reyes presents on Redmine, a free and open source project
management and issue tracking system written in Ruby on Rails. Prior to
this presentation, attendees are welcome and encouraged to
<a href="http://www.redmine.org">download it</a>, use a
<a href="http://demo.redmine.org">shared demo</a>
or try a private, <a href="http://www.webenabled.com">one-click install</a>.</p>

<p>Popular with (but certainly not limited to) the Ruby on Rails developer
community, Redmine is a full-featured system used by companies, open
source projects, governmental agencies, and individual developers around
the world. Big users of Redmine include open source projects such as
Ruby, Puppet, Gentoo, Lighttpd, TYPO3, and the Redmine project itself.</p>

<p>This presentation will focus on how Redmine is used from the
perspectives of developers, tech leads and project managers at a
software development company. Features that will be demonstrated include:</p>

<ul>
<li>User and group management;</li>
<li>Feeds, email notifications and web-to-mail and mail-to-web support;</li>
<li>Per-project role-based permissions,</li>
<li>Time tracking and reports; including calendaring and Gantt charts;</li>
<li>Issue workflow management across multiple roles;</li>
<li>Redmine&#8217;s plug-in architecture and growing developer ecosystem;</li>
<li>Custom fields for extending user accounts, time entries, and other
data structures;</li>
<li>Redmine&#8217;s REST API and how it integrates with third-party platforms.</li>
</ul>


<p>Christefano is one of the founders of Exaltation of Larks, a Drupal
strategy, development and training company; and Droplabs, a coworking
space and classroom near Downtown Los Angeles. As an advocate of open
source software, he helps organize meetups and conferences all over the
Greater Los Angeles Area. In his spare time, he trains as an amateur

<p><strong><em>Please note that we are in a different room this month. Signs will be posted, but please check out the directions given under Location:</em></strong></p>

<p>A modern day Linux Infrastructure should be flexible, scalable and able to deal
with the constant changes any business will require.  Automation is key to a
reliable and consistence server infrastructure, Automation also allows for easy
integration of new changes.</p>

<p>The DevOps movement melds two traditionally siloed teams; Application
Developers and Operations Engineers.  Writing infrastructure as code presents a
number of challenges and potential pitfalls, Operations Engineers need to write
code (something they may not be familar with) and Developers need to have a
strong understanding of the system (many Developers don&#8217;t want to be considered
with anything other than web applications).  There are several major projects
related purely to the management of infrastructure as code.</p>

<p>We will examine Opscode Chef and make a strong use case for the implementation
of Opscode Chef in a Linux Environment.  David will demonstrate many techniques
to utilize Chef quickly and efficiently to minimize the time of implementation.
Although Opscode Chef can be run on Solaris, FreeBSD and even Windows, the
presentation will discuss Linux and only Linux.  David will also discuss the
techniques to operate Chef on various Linux Distros which can provide a layer
of abstraction from the package management systems (apt &amp; yum).  Finally David
will discuss how Chef can be used to rebuild an Entire infrastructure
(regardless of size or complexity) in a time previous thought impossible.  The
only limitation in speed of deployment is the hardware.</p>

If you enter near our usual room (Downs 107),  go down the hallway, hang a right, go past the elevators, and take the stairs up one level.  As soon as you come out on the 2nd floor, the classroom is on the left hand side.  If you take the elevator, you will want to head left after getting off the elevator.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its time to face the music: There&#8217;s only a couple guys in Ops, and a
lot of infrastructure to set up and it was all due yesterday. If only
you could clone all the sysadmins of the world to get all of their
expertise and know-how in deploying open source applications, you could
actually get it done. Perhaps there is a way: Juju and Charms! Juju
encapsulates services in a way that promotes sharing and collaboration
the same way packages have done for open source software.  If you are
a sysadmin or a developer who is looking to get an infrastructure of
databases, loadbalancers, and webapps up to speed rapidly, Juju may
be interesting. If you are looking into deploying something massively
scalable, like OpenStack or Hadoop, Juju is built to handle that task.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The two dominant python-based web frameworks are Django and Pylons. They can be used to deploy web applications such as news sites, online ticket tracking systems, or wikis. An overview and comparison of Django and the recently reinvented Pylons Project will be presented. Individual dependencies of the Pylons Project will be described including the Pyramid WSGI engine, the SQLAlchemy database Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and the Mako HTML template generator. A very simple blog engine will be implemented as an instructive example.</p>
