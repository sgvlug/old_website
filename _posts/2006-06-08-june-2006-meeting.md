A couple of "Core OS" developers from Linspire will be our guest speakers, and 
they'll talk about the interesting languages and technologies they use in      
their distribution. When asked what they will present in detail, Clifford      
responded, "The core OS group at Linspire recently announced that we are       
standardizing on Haskell as our primary development language, whenever         
appropriate. In reality, we have been using both O'Caml and Haskell for years. 
Projects include:                                                              
* hardware detection and configuration,                                      
* creation of installation CDs,                                              
* package dependancy checker,                                                
* translation utilities for IRMA, and                                        
* many internal CGI/Web applications.                                        
                                                                             
"In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source development  
model, functional programming provides us an eye of tranquility. In            
particular, static typing has proven invaluable. We will discuss the benefits  
of systems programming with functional languages using the management of a     
Linux distribution as an example."
