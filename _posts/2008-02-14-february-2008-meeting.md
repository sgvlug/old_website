Chris got his kid an "OLPC" laptop and thinks he can wrestle it away from him  
long enough for some "show-n-tell"...                                          
                                                                             
OLPC is the "One Laptop Per Child" initiative, aimed at providing full-fledged 
laptop computers to every child in developing nations. Their goal is for a     
$100/unit price point, and they are quite close (actually, the price is about  
$150)                                                                          
                                                                             
Date: Thursday February 14, 2008 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                               
Location: Downs 107
