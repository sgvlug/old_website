Topic for November: Answering the Northrup Grumman Lunar Lander X PRIZE        
Challenge                                                                      
                                                                             
The Northrup Grumman Lunar Lander X Prize Challenge, a NASA space competition  
prize contest, is intended to foster the commercial development of a vehicle   
capable of launching from the surface of the moon into lunar orbit and then    
land back on the moon. Consisting of two levels of difficulty, a prize is      
given to the 1st and 2nd place winners of each level. Unreasonable Rocket, one 
of three teams that competed at this year's event, attempted to claim purses   
from both competition levels.                                                  
                                                                             
Come listen to the team from Unreasonable Rocket share their experience in     
this year's event.
