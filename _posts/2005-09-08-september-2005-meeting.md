Matt Ingenthron from Sun Microsystems will review Sun's involvement in the     
various open source communities and talk a bit about the latest, greatest hunk 
of intellectual property Sun's released to the wild: OpenSolaris.              
                                                                             
Matt will discuss OpenSolaris's goals, how licensing works (and why you        
shouldn't be afraid of it) and how to get involved. This meeting will also     
cover what OpenSolaris is (and isn't) and have a brief demo. Take a look at    
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/about/ before attending to develop your own      
questions about the project.                                                   
                                                                             
Matt is a Technical Specialist for Sun Microsystems and supports a variety of  
customers across the Western US. Based in Los Angeles, Matt has worked with a  
number of customers on Linux and Solaris adoption and migration from other     
platforms. Matt is part of the Web Services practice of the Client Solutions   
organization which specializes in use of Java Enterprise System software use   
by customers on both platforms.
