MySQL replication. MySQL Replication is the means by which one or more MySQL   
databases can keep data synchronized with a master server. The scope of        
replicated data can cover any range, whether a single table, or                
indiscriminately all the databases on the master server. MySQL Replication is  
beginning to find progressively more exposure in corporate production          
environments, where it sees use from providing hot backups, to distributing    
access load amongst large numbers of users. Solomon Chang will cover four main 
topics:                                                                        
* Requirements of MySQL Replication                                          
* Concepts of MySQL Replication                                              
* Configuring MySQL Replication                                              
* Troubleshooting MySQL Replication                                          
                                                                             
Soloman will provide a master to replicate from, so attendees are encouraged   
to bring their own computers running MySQL (4.1 or later, please) to configure 
as a hands-on slave. Attendees will also have full access to Solomon's master. 
If there is time, more advanced topics will be discussed:                      
* Pyramid Architectures                                                      
* Dual Masters                                                               
* Circular Replication                                                       
* Circular Replication of Masters
