Monthly Meeting.                                                               
                                                                             
Topic: Virtualmin / Webmin + Brief review Defcon/Blackhat:                     
------------------------------------------------------------                   
                                                                             
Take your Drupal sites to the next level with the free, open-source Webmin     
control panel and its powerful Virtualmin plug-in. Add as many features as you 
want, including unlimited domains, mail accounts, Subversion repositories,     
mailing lists, and more with a point-and-click web interface.                  
                                                                             
Webmin and Virtualmin are similar to cPanel and WHM, respectively, and can     
manage dozens or even hundreds of domains. They are the perfect tools for      
creating test and development sites, hosting client websites or even managing  
a full-blown online infrastructure for running a business.                     
                                                                             
Did we forget to mention, Webmin and Virtualmin are free* and open-source?     
Compared to site licensing costs of cPanel, WHM, Plesk and other proprietary   
control panels, Webmin and Virtualmin cost only as much as a basic             
$10-20/month VPS account.
