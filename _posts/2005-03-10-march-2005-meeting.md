"Linux is the dominant OS for motion picture industry desktops and servers.    
Most of the blockbuster films in theaters today were produced using Linux. How 
did this happen? Why are all the large studios using Linux as their preferred  
platform for creating feature animation and visual effects?"                   
                                                                             
Robin Rowe is the founder of LinuxMovies.org, launched in 2002 for the         
advancement of Linux motion picture technology. He's the project leader for    
CinePaint, free open source software used to create visual effects in THE LAST 
SAMURAI and other feature films. He's a former Linux Journal columnist.
