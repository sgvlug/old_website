Monthly meeting.                                                               
                                                                             
April 2010: An open-source 8-bit computer to save the world Braddock is back!  
                                                                             
Braddock Gaskill will discuss and debut his open source hardware and software  
project designed both for hobbyists and as an e-book reader for developing     
nations.                                                                       
                                                                             
The device can store a 5,000 book library or the better part of Wikipedia and  
display it on any TV set in a developing-world village library - all for under 
$20. It is also a fun general purpose 8-bit computing platform comparable in   
raw capability to the Apple II and built, in part, for experimentation and     
hobbyists. The entire system is open sourced, and uses GNU toolchain cross     
development under Linux with heavy OSS throughout.                             
                                                                             
The presentation will work through the design, schematic, PCB fab, assembly,   
and software dev. Braddock will walk the audience through each stage, cover    
which tools were used, ponder major design considerations, and pay special     
attention to open source solutions.                                            
                                                                             
Date: Thursday April 8, 2010 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                                   
Location: Downs 107
