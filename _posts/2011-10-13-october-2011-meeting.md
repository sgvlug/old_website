Command Line "Tips and Tricks"                                                 
                                                                             
Lan Dang spends the majority of her working hours monitoring and               
troubleshooting data processing systems on Linux-based computer clusters. She  
has accumulated a number of tips and tricks to deal with the command line. Her 
arsenal includes: GNU screen, awk, sed, shell scripting, remote ssh command    
execution, bash command history, and a variety of system utilities. This talk  
will cover useful one-liners and the small set of useful commands that will    
get you started using these tools or using them in new ways. Whether you're a  
newbie or a command line guru, you'll probably pick up something useful for    
the next time you're at the command line.
