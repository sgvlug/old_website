Ronald Stewart, creative director of the Trinity Audio Group will speak at the 
next San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group. He will present the                  
yet-to-be-released InDaMixx appliance, a full-featured, hand-held recording    
studio built on Linux (a customized version of 64Studio, to be more specific). 
He will go over topics such as why Linux was chosen, the future of music in    
the open-source community and will demo some of the great features of          
InDaMixx.                                                                      
                                                                             
Ronald's background in the music industry goes back to the late 80's as a DJ & 
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records & one of 
the first beta testers for Digidesign's Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he      
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his  
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,       
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and      
hasn't looked back ever since.
