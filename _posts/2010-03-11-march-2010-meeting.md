Topic: Data Ownership - How I (mostly) wrestled control of my data from evil   
corporate overlords                                                            
                                                                             
Speaker: Charles N Wyble                                                       
                                                                             
Charles Wyble is a systems and security engineer. His focus in 2010 is         
security research, with a particular emphasis on improving performance of      
automated analytic systems. In support of this, he does a lot of networking    
stuff and is in the process of building a malware lab.                         
                                                                             
He lives in sunny southern California, with his wife Patricia and 2 dogs ISIS  
and OSPF. Yes they are named after routing protocols. He frequently hosts      
hacker parties, where all sorts of cool stuff gets built. You will often find  
him at various hot startups doing consulting, and at numerous user group       
meetings throughout the southwestern United States.                            
                                                                             
Charles Wyble will be joining the SGVLUG group once again and discussing the   
topic of data ownership / private cloud.                                       
                                                                             
Owning ones data is a critical and often overlooked part of security. As such, 
he will discuss how he maintains numerous web properties on a Linux server at  
his residence, connected to the best DSL ATT has to offer.                     
                                                                             
He has recently completed moving all his data onto his own server, freeing it  
(mostly) from the control of google,yahoo etc. It was a relatively             
straightforward process, encompassing 4 major phases. He will talk about the   
tools he utilizes, and advantages/disadvantages to his setup and some of the   
problems he encountered.
