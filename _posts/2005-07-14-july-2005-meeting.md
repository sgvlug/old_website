"Ubuntu: Linux from Outer Space," Jana Lingo.                                  
                                                                             
What does an Internet pioneer and tycoon do when he still has too much money   
after paying the Russians to take him to the International Space Station? If   
you're Mark Shuttleworth, you start a Linux Company.                           
                                                                             
Jana Lingo will discuss the past, present, and future of one of the *hottest*  
current Linux distributions. Topics will include Ubuntu*s goals, philosophy,   
history, and technology, as well as Jana*s personal experiences with Ubuntu    
and its derivates.                                                             
                                                                             
Ms. Lingo has over 15 years of Information technology experience, both as a    
programmer and as a manager. She is currently working as a contract programmer 
for Unisys Corporation / Los Angeles County, in El Monte.
