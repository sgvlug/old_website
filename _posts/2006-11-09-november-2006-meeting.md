Monitoring the Local Weather with Linux                                        
                                                                             
There are plenty of websites that will give you a weather report for your      
city, but what about your neighborhood? Ever wonder how hot your attic got     
during the summer or how well your air conditioner is working? Claude          
Felizardo will describe his 1-wire weather station and how it has grown from a 
simple kit with a single temperature sensor, wind speed, and direction to      
multiple sensors located throughout his house and publishes the measurements   
to the Internet.                                                               
                                                                             
About the Presenter:                                                           
                                                                             
Claude has over 15 years experience developing software on Unix platforms and  
has been playing with Linux since the late 90's. His friends and family think  
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play     
with, especially if it works with Linux.
