The Caltech team participating in the U.S. Department of Energy 2011 Solar     
Decathlon will present their project, for which they are using various         
open-source technology.                                                        
                                                                             
"The Solar Decathlon is a U.S. Department of Energy Sponsored competition      
which challenges teams of college and graduate students from around the world  
to design and build solar-powered, net-zero houses. Inside the SCI-Arc/Caltech 
entry, code named CHIP, a sophisticated home automation system monitors every  
watt of electricity consumed and visually communicates the information to      
homeowners. It also plays a central role in optimizing the behavior of the     
house at all times, such as by controlling operation of the active thermal     
mass, shutting down appliances or lights that are no longer used, and of       
course giving the homeowners an instant understanding into how their own       
behaviors affects their energy use and in turn their energy bill."
