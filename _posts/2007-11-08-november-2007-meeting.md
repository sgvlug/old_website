Asterisk is an open-source PBX program that provides automatic call            
distribution, voice mail and interactive voice response menus. X10 is a        
power-line carrier protocol for controlling lights and appliances. What can    
you do when you combine them? Claude Felizardo will give us an update on his   
home-automation system and how integrating Asterisk has moved his home closer  
to what is depicted in popular science fiction.                                
                                                                             
With over 15 years as a Unix developer, Claude got his start with Linux in the 
late 90s when he built his own firewall. Most of his friends and family think  
he has too many gadgets, but he's always looking for something new to play     
with, especially if it can be integrated into his system at home. His previous 
presentations include an Intro to Home Automation, Hacking TiVo and Monitoring 
the Weather with Linux.

Location: Downs 107
