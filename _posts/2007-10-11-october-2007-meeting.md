Kris Bergstrom will give an introduction to the extremely powerful LaTeX       
typesetting system and its application to real-world document production. He   
will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters      
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his       
band's annual fund drive which requires the creation of personalized letters   
(mail merge) and envelopes.                                                    
                                                                             
Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system          
incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system          
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with   
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The     
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic   
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its        
commercial program, InDesign).                                                 
                                                                             
About the presenter:                                                           
Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at   
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,       
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from    
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin     
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to   
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he    
needed to do all his personal and business computer tasks with free software.
