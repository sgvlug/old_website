Dan Kegel of Google, a longtime Linux user and developer, will present a       
grab-bag of interesting topics:                                                
* Quick Picasa 2.7 for Linux demo. (Picasa is Google's photo management      
  software for Windows and Linux, but many people don't know about the Linux 
  version)                                                                   
* Quick Wine status report. (Wine is Linux's implementation of Win32; it     
  lets you run many Windows applications.)                                   
* Introduction to Zumastor. (Zumastor is Linux's answer to ZFS, kind of; it  
  lets you take atomic snapshots of any filesystem, and easily replicate     
  those snapshots to remote systems.)                                        
                                                                             
Dan is a developer for all three projects and was elected the release manager  
for the upcoming 1.0 release of Wine, so feel free to ask all the technical    
questions you like.
