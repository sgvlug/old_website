A Case Study in Open Source Software Development                               
                                                                             
For three years the speaker ran a small technology startup company developing  
new ways of visualizing and exploring huge datasets, like, for example, the    
entire routing structure of the internet, or tens of thousands of documents.   
                                                                             
This talk will cover real-world experiences with the broad variety of Open     
Source software which made the project possible. Dependencies included Boost,  
CMake, OpenSceneGraph, khtml, gecko, Firefox plugins, GraphViz, lighttpd,      
Xerces DOM, and more. Theses building blocks were in many cases pushed to (and 
beyond) their limits, deployed in a cross-platform Linux and Windows           
environment, and compiled with GCC and MSVC++. We will cover lessons learned,  
better alternatives, and other findings.
