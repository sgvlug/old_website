Why Linux needs to be more like Windows -or- Impediments to enterprise Linux   
adoption                                                                       
                                                                             
Our speaker is Steve Friedl, a software consultant in Orange County who's been 
using UNIX since the early '80s, using Windows since the late '80s, and has    
more than 20 years of cross-platform consulting and commercial software        
development experience. He has taught advanced C/UNIX at Bell Labs, and is the 
only Microsoft MVP with "unix" in his domain name (unixwiz.net).               
                                                                             
He'll be making the case that Linux has some stumbling blocks that make        
enterprise management and deployment much more difficult than they need to be, 
and what road there might be to make some progress on these fronts.
