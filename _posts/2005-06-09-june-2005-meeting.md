"Linux and JPL's Mars Exploration Rover Project: Earth-based Planning,         
Simulation, and Really Remote Scheduling," Scott Maxwell and Frank Hartman,    
NASA JPL.                                                                      
                                                                             
NASA/JPL's Mars Exploration Rover project is the first time a JPL flight       
project has used Linux systems for critical mission operations. Scott Maxwell  
and Frank Hartman, two of MER's rover drivers, also wrote the Rover Sequencing 
and Visualization Program (RSVP), the Linux-based software used on Earth to    
drive Spirit and Opportunity. Scott and Frank will discuss the software they   
developed, as well as their experiences using Linux to drive two vehicles      
across the Martian terrain, a hundred million miles from Earth.                
                                                                             
Date: Thursday June 9, 2005 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM                                    
Location: Downs 107
