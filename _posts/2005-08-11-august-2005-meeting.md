Orv Beach has been messing with computers for over 20 years. His first         
experience with computer operating systems was with CP/M, in the early '80s.   
His first Linux was Slackware, in 1996. Since then he's moved to Red Hat Linux 
and then Fedora Core. While not a programmer, he's actively involved in the    
Linux community.                                                               
                                                                             
He's a principal member of the Simi-Conejo Linux Users Group, the Marketing    
chair for the Linux Expo of Southern California, and is currently employed as  
the Information System Director at Simi Valley Hospital.                       
                                                                             
Orv will demonstrate various command line commands and utilities that are      
useful for administering a Linux system. He'll throw in a few basic bash       
tricks as a bonus.
