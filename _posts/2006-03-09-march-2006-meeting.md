Monthly meeting.                                                               
                                                                             
Due to a scheduling conflict, Chris was unable to present this last November,  
so we've asked him to return this month.                                       
                                                                             
Chris Smith of Yahoo! to present a slice of life-on-the-inside of the world's  
largest content provider.                                                      
                                                                             
Chris will demonstrate some of the cutting edge work being conducted at Yahoo! 
Research Labs, all of which is powered by UNIX and open source computing.
