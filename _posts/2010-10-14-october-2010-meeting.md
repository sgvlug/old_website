Filling the Digital Divide with Offline Content: Six ways to deliver a library 
anywhere for under $90                                                         
                                                                             
SUMMARY                                                                        
                                                                             
Off-line content is reading material, educational texts, and other reference   
materials delivered on media such as SDCards, DVDs, custom hardware, or hard   
drives so that it can be used without internet access. A typical deployment    
can deliver the equivalent of tens of thousands of printed books. The cost to  
deliver large off-line libraries has fallen below the cost to deliver online   
internet access in most areas. Off-line content thus provides a cost effective 
way to provide access to the world's knowledge before affordable internet      
infrastructure is available. This presentation reviews six emerging projects   
which aim to provide off-line hardware and libraries, including the author's   
creation, the $20 Humane Reader
