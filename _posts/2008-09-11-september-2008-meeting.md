Michael Proctor-Smith will give an update on MythTV (the Mythical Convergence  
Box), the open-source alternative to TiVo or Windows Media Center. More than   
just a digital VCR, which provides basic "time shifting" capability, Digital   
Video Recorders change the way people watch television by providing the        
ability to pause live TV, instantly replay interesting scenes, and skip        
commercials. With an up-to-date TV schedule, the DVR can automatically record  
shows based on user preferences.                                               
                                                                             
Michael will talk about his strange MythTV setup and a small portion of        
MythTV's features including Recording HDTV, streaming to a Cell Phone and      
using an AppleTV as a MythTV Front-end.                                        
                                                                             
Michael Runs The San Gabriel Valley Linux(R) Users Group (At least he has been 
told that by others). He spends an unhealthy amount of his time watching       
MythTV and plotting how he can never be without access to MythTV.

Location: Downs 107
