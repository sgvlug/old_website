The two dominant python-based web frameworks are Django and Pylons. They can be used to deploy web applications such as news sites, online ticket tracking systems, or wikis. An overview and comparison of Django and the recently reinvented Pylons Project will be presented. Individual dependencies of the Pylons Project will be described including the Pyramid WSGI engine, the SQLAlchemy database Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and the Mako HTML template generator. A very simple blog engine will be implemented as an instructive example.
