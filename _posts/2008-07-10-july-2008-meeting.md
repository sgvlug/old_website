In a presentation called "Geotagging with Linux and Free Software," Tom        
Emerson will describe geotagging, the process of adding geographical           
information to images, which can later be searched. Emerson will show how he   
has geotagged photos from his recent vacation and can search for them using    
various search engines, including Google Earth.
