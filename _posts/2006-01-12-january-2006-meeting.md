Charles Finley of Transformix will be here to show off the Eclipse IDE by IBM. 
By popular vote, the presentation will be targeting the beginner, but there    
will be plenty of opportunity to dig into deeper subjects.

HP 3000, as well as on a variety of large-scale computers, minicomputers, and  
personal computers. He has over 30 years of combined experience in the data    
processing industry and has held both technical and management positions. He   
has conducted over 70 computer-related seminars throughout the U.S. and Canada 
and is a former faculty member of the Industrial Relations Center at the       
California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) in Pasadena. He studied          
management at UCLA, received a Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) from the
