  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ubuntu is the said to be the biggest thing in desktop Linux at the moment, but
Neal and Nathan are here to cut through the hype and show you how Ubuntu can <br/>
simplify your life and make your computer more fun and simple to use for     <br/>
everyday tasks. They will discuss various aspects of Ubuntu, from the basics <br/>
of everyday system maintenance to how to customize your system. They will also
cover the differences that make Ubuntu unique from Debian and other distros; <br/>
and the differences and benefits of the various flavors that make up the     <br/>
Ubuntu family.</p>

<p>Nathan Haines is a computer consultant and instructor who enjoys programming <br/>
in Python and is a member of the California Ubuntu LoCo team. Neal Bussett is<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wilfred Nilsen will present the BarracudaDrive, a secure Web application server
for the Linksys NSLU2 (Network Storage Link for USB 2.0 Disk Drives) using the<br/>
Unslung Linux firmware replacement. Using an external USB Flash memory for    <br/>
storing the database files, it should be possible to create an application    <br/>
server that is virtually maintenance free.</p>

<p>Wilfred will be here to give a demo of the NSLU2 running BarracudaDrive,      <br/>
including the many practical features of BarracudaDrive and how some users use<br/>
BarracudaDrive for many non traditional Web server tasks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ronald Stewart, creative director of the Trinity Audio Group will speak at the
next San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group. He will present the                <br/>
yet-to-be-released InDaMixx appliance, a full-featured, hand-held recording  <br/>
studio built on Linux (a customized version of 64Studio, to be more specific).
He will go over topics such as why Linux was chosen, the future of music in  <br/>
the open-source community and will demo some of the great features of        <br/>
InDaMixx.</p>

<p>Ronald&#8217;s background in the music industry goes back to the late 80&#8217;s as a DJ &amp;
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records &amp; one of
the first beta testers for Digidesign&#8217;s Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he    <br/>
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his<br/>
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,     <br/>
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and    <br/>
hasn&#8217;t looked back ever since.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dan Kegel of Google, a longtime Linux user and developer, will present a     <br/>
grab-bag of interesting topics:                                              <br/>
* Quick Picasa 2.7 for Linux demo. (Picasa is Google&#8217;s photo management    <br/>
  software for Windows and Linux, but many people don&#8217;t know about the Linux
  version)                                                                 <br/>
* Quick Wine status report. (Wine is Linux&#8217;s implementation of Win32; it   <br/>
  lets you run many Windows applications.)                                 <br/>
* Introduction to Zumastor. (Zumastor is Linux&#8217;s answer to ZFS, kind of; it<br/>
  lets you take atomic snapshots of any filesystem, and easily replicate   <br/>
  those snapshots to remote systems.)</p>

<p>Dan is a developer for all three projects and was elected the release manager<br/>
for the upcoming 1.0 release of Wine, so feel free to ask all the technical  <br/>
questions you like.</p>

power-line carrier protocol for controlling lights and appliances. What can  <br/>
you do when you combine them? Claude Felizardo will give us an update on his <br/>
home-automation system and how integrating Asterisk has moved his home closer<br/>
to what is depicted in popular science fiction.</p>

<p>With over 15 years as a Unix developer, Claude got his start with Linux in the
late 90s when he built his own firewall. Most of his friends and family think<br/>
he has too many gadgets, but he&#8217;s always looking for something new to play   <br/>
with, especially if it can be integrated into his system at home. His previous
presentations include an Intro to Home Automation, Hacking TiVo and Monitoring
the Weather with Linux.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kris Bergstrom will give an introduction to the extremely powerful LaTeX     <br/>
typesetting system and its application to real-world document production. He <br/>
will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters    <br/>
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his     <br/>
band&#8217;s annual fund drive which requires the creation of personalized letters <br/>
(mail merge) and envelopes.</p>

<p>Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system        <br/>
incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system        <br/>
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with <br/>
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The   <br/>
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic <br/>
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its      <br/>
commercial program, InDesign).</p>

<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br/>
Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at <br/>
Stanford&#8217;s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,     <br/>
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from  <br/>
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin   <br/>
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to <br/>
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he  <br/>
needed to do all his personal and business computer tasks with free software.</p>
