  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why Linux needs to be more like Windows -or- Impediments to enterprise Linux <br/>
adoption</p>

<p>Our speaker is Steve Friedl, a software consultant in Orange County who&#8217;s been
using UNIX since the early &#8217;80s, using Windows since the late &#8217;80s, and has  <br/>
more than 20 years of cross-platform consulting and commercial software      <br/>
development experience. He has taught advanced C/UNIX at Bell Labs, and is the
only Microsoft MVP with &#8220;unix&#8221; in his domain name (unixwiz.net).</p>

<p>He&#8217;ll be making the case that Linux has some stumbling blocks that make      <br/>
enterprise management and deployment much more difficult than they need to be,
and what road there might be to make some progress on these fronts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monitoring the Local Weather with Linux</p>

<p>There are plenty of websites that will give you a weather report for your    <br/>
city, but what about your neighborhood? Ever wonder how hot your attic got   <br/>
during the summer or how well your air conditioner is working? Claude        <br/>
Felizardo will describe his 1-wire weather station and how it has grown from a
simple kit with a single temperature sensor, wind speed, and direction to    <br/>
multiple sensors located throughout his house and publishes the measurements <br/>
to the Internet.</p>

<p>About the Presenter:</p>

<p>Claude has over 15 years experience developing software on Unix platforms and<br/>
has been playing with Linux since the late 90&#8217;s. His friends and family think<br/>
he has too many gadgets, but he&#8217;s always looking for something new to play   <br/>
with, especially if it works with Linux.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>MySQL replication. MySQL Replication is the means by which one or more MySQL <br/>
databases can keep data synchronized with a master server. The scope of      <br/>
replicated data can cover any range, whether a single table, or              <br/>
indiscriminately all the databases on the master server. MySQL Replication is<br/>
beginning to find progressively more exposure in corporate production        <br/>
environments, where it sees use from providing hot backups, to distributing  <br/>
access load amongst large numbers of users. Solomon Chang will cover four main
topics:                                                                      <br/>
* Requirements of MySQL Replication                                        <br/>
* Concepts of MySQL Replication                                            <br/>
* Configuring MySQL Replication                                            <br/>
* Troubleshooting MySQL Replication</p>

<p>Soloman will provide a master to replicate from, so attendees are encouraged <br/>
to bring their own computers running MySQL (4.1 or later, please) to configure
as a hands-on slave. Attendees will also have full access to Solomon&#8217;s master.
If there is time, more advanced topics will be discussed:                    <br/>
* Pyramid Architectures                                                    <br/>
* Dual Masters                                                             <br/>
* Circular Replication</p>

<h2>* Circular Replication of Masters                                            </h2>

<p>About the Speaker.</p>

<p>Solomon Chang, a MySQL-certified DBA, practices his skills at PriceGrabber.com
and has been involved with LAMPsig since its inception in 2003. He is also   <br/>
currently co-authoring the MySQL Cluster Certification Guide by MySQL Press.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of &#8220;Core OS&#8221; developers from Linspire will be our guest speakers, and
they&#8217;ll talk about the interesting languages and technologies they use in    <br/>
their distribution. When asked what they will present in detail, Clifford    <br/>
responded, &#8220;The core OS group at Linspire recently announced that we are     <br/>
standardizing on Haskell as our primary development language, whenever       <br/>
appropriate. In reality, we have been using both O&#8217;Caml and Haskell for years.
Projects include:                                                            <br/>
* hardware detection and configuration,                                    <br/>
* creation of installation CDs,                                            <br/>
* package dependancy checker,                                              <br/>
* translation utilities for IRMA, and                                      <br/>
* many internal CGI/Web applications.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source development<br/>
model, functional programming provides us an eye of tranquility. In          <br/>
particular, static typing has proven invaluable. We will discuss the benefits<br/>
of systems programming with functional languages using the management of a   <br/>
Linux distribution as an example.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The topic for the evening will be &#8220;Getting a job in 2006: Is it the dot-com  <br/>
bubble all over again?&#8221; This event will include a presentation on the current<br/>
state of the job market in Los Angeles, with special emphasis on tech roles  <br/>
and open-source fields. There will also be a primer on how to prepare yourself
to land the best job possible. Whether you are a linux guru or a newbie, this<br/>
session will provide valuable information on how to land a great job. A major<br/>
theme will be how to think like a corporate recruiter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PGP is an amazing tool for verification and encryption. However, many people <br/>
don&#8217;t fully understand it-even people who use it. This talk mostly will cover<br/>
uses and effects of PGP. The discussion will focus on PGP and e-mail, and    <br/>
other topics will be covered as well. How cryptography works and the math    <br/>
behind it will not be covered.</p>

<p>Keysigning party</p>

<p>One of the key features of PGP is the &#8220;web of trust&#8221; that grows out of       <br/>
individuals signing each other&#8217;s keys as a way of validating that the        <br/>
keyholder is indeed the &#8220;owner&#8221; of the key. We encourge you to create a key  <br/>
(if you don&#8217;t already have one), post it to a public keyserver, and bring your
&#8220;fingerprint&#8221; to the meeting for a keysigning party.</p>
