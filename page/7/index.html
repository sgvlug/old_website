  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ronald Stewart, creative director of the Trinity Audio Group will speak at the
next San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group. He will present the                <br/>
yet-to-be-released InDaMixx appliance, a full-featured, hand-held recording  <br/>
studio built on Linux (a customized version of 64Studio, to be more specific).
He will go over topics such as why Linux was chosen, the future of music in  <br/>
the open-source community and will demo some of the great features of        <br/>
InDaMixx.</p>

<p>Ronald&#8217;s background in the music industry goes back to the late 80&#8217;s as a DJ &amp;
Remixer for Factor 3 Records, Tommy Boy Records, Bullet Proof Records &amp; one of
the first beta testers for Digidesign&#8217;s Pro Tools. Ronald decided that he    <br/>
needed a full-featured device that he could take with him, along with all his<br/>
music only to find out nothing like this existed. Ever the frontiersman,     <br/>
Ronald decided to blaze the trail, chose all open-source applications and    <br/>
hasn&#8217;t looked back ever since.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dan Kegel of Google, a longtime Linux user and developer, will present a     <br/>
grab-bag of interesting topics:                                              <br/>
* Quick Picasa 2.7 for Linux demo. (Picasa is Google&#8217;s photo management    <br/>
  software for Windows and Linux, but many people don&#8217;t know about the Linux
  version)                                                                 <br/>
* Quick Wine status report. (Wine is Linux&#8217;s implementation of Win32; it   <br/>
  lets you run many Windows applications.)                                 <br/>
* Introduction to Zumastor. (Zumastor is Linux&#8217;s answer to ZFS, kind of; it<br/>
  lets you take atomic snapshots of any filesystem, and easily replicate   <br/>
  those snapshots to remote systems.)</p>

<p>Dan is a developer for all three projects and was elected the release manager<br/>
for the upcoming 1.0 release of Wine, so feel free to ask all the technical  <br/>
questions you like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Asterisk is an open-source PBX program that provides automatic call          <br/>
distribution, voice mail and interactive voice response menus. X10 is a      <br/>
power-line carrier protocol for controlling lights and appliances. What can  <br/>
you do when you combine them? Claude Felizardo will give us an update on his <br/>
home-automation system and how integrating Asterisk has moved his home closer<br/>
to what is depicted in popular science fiction.</p>

<p>With over 15 years as a Unix developer, Claude got his start with Linux in the
late 90s when he built his own firewall. Most of his friends and family think<br/>
he has too many gadgets, but he&#8217;s always looking for something new to play   <br/>
with, especially if it can be integrated into his system at home. His previous
presentations include an Intro to Home Automation, Hacking TiVo and Monitoring
the Weather with Linux.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kris Bergstrom will give an introduction to the extremely powerful LaTeX     <br/>
typesetting system and its application to real-world document production. He <br/>
will explain how he uses it in the creation of essays, books, and letters    <br/>
incorporating graphics. He will also demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his     <br/>
band&#8217;s annual fund drive which requires the creation of personalized letters <br/>
(mail merge) and envelopes.</p>

<p>Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system        <br/>
incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The system        <br/>
successfully handles the automatic typesetting of complicated textbooks with <br/>
thousands of images and internal page, chapter, and figure references. The   <br/>
line-breaking algorithm used by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic <br/>
TeX engine) is the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its      <br/>
commercial program, InDesign).</p>

<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br/>
Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at <br/>
Stanford&#8217;s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000,     <br/>
excited by the ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from  <br/>
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic admin   <br/>
tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running. Soon after moving to <br/>
Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users Group and found the support he  <br/>
needed to do all his personal and business computer tasks with free software.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kerry Garrison is back to demo the new trixbox Pro product from Fonality. This
latest incarnation uses the hybrid-hosted model developed by Fonality for    <br/>
PBXtra, but gives installers the control over the hardware and phone         <br/>
provisioning that they enjoy with trixbox CE.</p>

<p>Kerry Garrison has been in the IT industry for over 20 years with positions  <br/>
ranging from IT Director of a large multi-site distribution company to       <br/>
developing a large hosted web server platform for a major ISP, to running his<br/>
own IT consulting business in Southern California. Kerry was introduced to the
world of Asterisk by a friend and began installing Asterisk-based phone      <br/>
systems for his small business clients. He wrote articles about Asterisk and <br/>
trixbox that became extremely popular on the net, and eventually published the
definitive book on trixbox, &#8220;trixbox Made Easy.&#8221; Today, Kerry is the senior  <br/>
product development manager for trixbox at Fonality. Kerry regularly speaks at
trade shows, user groups, and radio programs. He is also the publisher of both
http://www.voipspeak.net and http://www.asterisktutorials.com. Kerry is an   <br/>
avid amateur photographer who writes tutorials and product reviews for his   <br/>
photography blog site at http://L7Foto.com.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>X509 and SSL are complicated topics. While they share the basic PKI          <br/>
infrastructure that PGP and others do, X509 (and SSL by extension) are more  <br/>
complicated. Extending beyond the basic encryption, signing, decryption, and <br/>
verification of basic PKI, X509 includes a variety of extra pieces and       <br/>
information enabling more features. This talk will cover what X509 and SSL   <br/>
are, how they relate, how to use them, and how to learn more. It will discuss<br/>
PKI from both an certificate end-user perspective as well as from a          <br/>
Certificate Authority perspective. If time permits, a small comparison to PGP<br/>
will also be included akin to the one at the end of my PGP talk.</p>
