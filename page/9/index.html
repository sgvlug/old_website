  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of &#8220;Core OS&#8221; developers from Linspire will be our guest speakers, and
they&#8217;ll talk about the interesting languages and technologies they use in    <br/>
their distribution. When asked what they will present in detail, Clifford    <br/>
responded, &#8220;The core OS group at Linspire recently announced that we are     <br/>
standardizing on Haskell as our primary development language, whenever       <br/>
appropriate. In reality, we have been using both O&#8217;Caml and Haskell for years.
Projects include:                                                            <br/>
* hardware detection and configuration,                                    <br/>
* creation of installation CDs,                                            <br/>
* package dependancy checker,                                              <br/>
* translation utilities for IRMA, and                                      <br/>
* many internal CGI/Web applications.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source development<br/>
model, functional programming provides us an eye of tranquility. In          <br/>
particular, static typing has proven invaluable. We will discuss the benefits<br/>
of systems programming with functional languages using the management of a   <br/>
Linux distribution as an example.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The topic for the evening will be &#8220;Getting a job in 2006: Is it the dot-com  <br/>
bubble all over again?&#8221; This event will include a presentation on the current<br/>
state of the job market in Los Angeles, with special emphasis on tech roles  <br/>
and open-source fields. There will also be a primer on how to prepare yourself
to land the best job possible. Whether you are a linux guru or a newbie, this<br/>
session will provide valuable information on how to land a great job. A major<br/>
theme will be how to think like a corporate recruiter.</p>

<p>About the presenter:                                                         <br/>
For over 5 years, Todd Cranston-Cuebas has led technology hiring at          <br/>
Ticketmaster. He specializes in working with candidates who have backgrounds <br/>
in open-source tools and technologies. He has spoken at BOF sessions at a    <br/>
number of large technology conferences, including ApacheCon, OSCON, USENIX,  <br/>
and, of course, at SGVLUG meetings. He also is the scheduler and host for this
year&#8217;s monthly perl-centric &#8220;Tech Talks&#8221; for the LA.pm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PGP is an amazing tool for verification and encryption. However, many people <br/>
don&#8217;t fully understand it-even people who use it. This talk mostly will cover<br/>
uses and effects of PGP. The discussion will focus on PGP and e-mail, and    <br/>
other topics will be covered as well. How cryptography works and the math    <br/>
behind it will not be covered.</p>

<p>Keysigning party</p>

<p>One of the key features of PGP is the &#8220;web of trust&#8221; that grows out of       <br/>
individuals signing each other&#8217;s keys as a way of validating that the        <br/>
keyholder is indeed the &#8220;owner&#8221; of the key. We encourge you to create a key  <br/>
(if you don&#8217;t already have one), post it to a public keyserver, and bring your
&#8220;fingerprint&#8221; to the meeting for a keysigning party.</p>

<p>About the presenter</p>

<p>Phil Dibowitz is a UNIX systems administrator for the web systems team at    <br/>
Ticketmaster. The web systems team manages the Ticketmaster.com              <br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monthly meeting.</p>

<p>Due to a scheduling conflict, Chris was unable to present this last November,<br/>
so we&#8217;ve asked him to return this month.</p>

<p>Chris Smith of Yahoo! to present a slice of life-on-the-inside of the world&#8217;s<br/>
largest content provider.</p>

<p>Chris will demonstrate some of the cutting edge work being conducted at Yahoo!
Research Labs, all of which is powered by UNIX and open source computing.</p>

<p>A member of Yahoo!&#8217;s Research Technology team, Chris has more than 10 years of
experience developing enterprise software solutions for both Internet        <br/>
start-ups and as a Senior Java Architect for Sun Microsystems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monthly meeting.</p>

<p>When you mention &#8220;running more than one operating system&#8221; on a computer, most<br/>
people will think &#8220;dual boot&#8221;, and for a wide variety of tasks that is quite <br/>
appropriate. But how many of you have thought of running more than one system<br/>
at the same time? Sure, you&#8217;re only &#8220;one person,&#8221; so why should the computer <br/>
act like you were two people doing different things?</p>

<p>Well, you might not want to reboot your machine &#8211; especially if you have a  <br/>
long-running task going on such as &#8220;seti at home&#8221; (since rebooting will cause<br/>
the &#8220;work unit&#8221; to be lost.) You might be a developer, and you&#8217;re working on <br/>
something intended to be &#8220;cross platform&#8221; &#8211; if every &#8220;rebuild-and-test&#8221; cycle
included &#8220;reboot the machine&#8221;, you&#8217;d tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you
have two programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to  <br/>
refer to the output of one program while working on the other.</p>

<p>If this describes you and you haven&#8217;t heard of VMware, then you need to attend
the February SGVLUG meeting. This month we&#8217;ll have Phil Anthony, a Sr. Systems
Engineer from VMware, here to talk about what VMware has to offer &#8211; he plans<br/>
to talk about the entier line &#8211; from the ESX server to the workstation to   <br/>
their newest offering, the &#8220;free&#8221; VMware player. (this is &#8220;free as in beer&#8221;, <br/>
folks&#8230;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monthly meeting.</p>

<p>Charles Finley of Transformix will be here to show off the Eclipse IDE by IBM.
By popular vote, the presentation will be targeting the beginner, but there  <br/>
will be plenty of opportunity to dig into deeper subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley has extensive software development and consulting experience on the
HP 3000, as well as on a variety of large-scale computers, minicomputers, and<br/>
personal computers. He has over 30 years of combined experience in the data  <br/>
processing industry and has held both technical and management positions. He <br/>
has conducted over 70 computer-related seminars throughout the U.S. and Canada
and is a former faculty member of the Industrial Relations Center at the     <br/>
California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) in Pasadena. He studied        <br/>
management at UCLA, received a Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) from the <br/>
Data Processing Management Association, and holds a B.A. in business economics
from the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monthly meeting.</p>

<p>CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion   <br/>
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry<br/>
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add <br/>
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for <br/>
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application
in motion picture production.</p>

<p>CinePaint project leader Robin Rowe will talk about the new Glasgow          <br/>
architecture, what&#8217;s implemented, and what remains to be done. CinePaint     <br/>
Glasgow is scheduled for release on December 31, 2005. Glasgow runs on Linux,<br/>
Windows, and Mac OSX. Robin Rowe has led CinePaint since 2002. He&#8217;s the      <br/>
founder of LinuxMovies.org. He&#8217;s a partner in motion picture technology      <br/>
company MovieEditor.com.</p>
