  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unity is the new desktop environment for Ubuntu, having first premiered in   <br/>
version 11.04, significantly enhanced with version 11.10, and very much the  <br/>
cornerstone of the upcoming 12.04 release.</p>

<p>A striking departure from Gnome 2, Unity has been seen as a source of        <br/>
controversy in the Linux world.</p>

<p>This talk will outline some of the design goals that Unity addresses, noting <br/>
strengths, weaknesses, and improvements across the three versions of Ubuntu in
which it&#8217;s been included.</p>

<p>While Unity offers many usability affordances, some Ubuntu users prefer to   <br/>
customize it for their specific workflows. Linux is famous for its           <br/>
customizability, and Unity is no exception if you know which tools to look   <br/>
for.</p>

<p>This presentation will outline some of the tools available through the Ubuntu<br/>
Software Center to show you how to customize the Unity interface.</p>

<p>Speaker Bio: Richard Gaskin is President of Fourth World, a software design  <br/>
and development consultancy in Los Angeles. Since founding the company in    <br/>
1994, he&#8217;s developed dozens of commercial and open source applications used by
a wide range of organizations, including FedEx, AOL, the US Library of       <br/>
Congress, and hundreds of universities around the world.</p>

<p>Although he started his career with Mac OS, Richard has since delivered      <br/>
applications for Irix, every version of Windows, and has been developing for <br/>
Linux for the last two years.</p>

<p>Richard has spoken at more than a dozen tech conferences, including UbuCon,  <br/>
LiveCode Developer Conference, and MacTech where he had the distinction of   <br/>
being the only presenter using Linux.</p>

<p>Virtual Private Servers: On a Budget - We will discuss a class of virtual    <br/>
private servers available at a low price point allowing individuals to get   <br/>
many of the benefits of dedicated hardware without the cost thanks to        <br/>
virtualization technologies and a competitive marketplace.</p>

<p>Command Line &#8220;Tips and Tricks&#8221;</p>

<p>Lan Dang spends the majority of her working hours monitoring and             <br/>
troubleshooting data processing systems on Linux-based computer clusters. She<br/>
has accumulated a number of tips and tricks to deal with the command line. Her
arsenal includes: GNU screen, awk, sed, shell scripting, remote ssh command  <br/>
execution, bash command history, and a variety of system utilities. This talk<br/>
will cover useful one-liners and the small set of useful commands that will  <br/>
get you started using these tools or using them in new ways. Whether you&#8217;re a<br/>
newbie or a command line guru, you&#8217;ll probably pick up something useful for  <br/>
the next time you&#8217;re at the command line.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monthly Meeting.</p>

<h2>Topic: Virtualmin / Webmin + Brief review Defcon/Blackhat:                     </h2>

<p>Take your Drupal sites to the next level with the free, open-source Webmin   <br/>
control panel and its powerful Virtualmin plug-in. Add as many features as you
want, including unlimited domains, mail accounts, Subversion repositories,   <br/>
mailing lists, and more with a point-and-click web interface.</p>

<p>Webmin and Virtualmin are similar to cPanel and WHM, respectively, and can   <br/>
manage dozens or even hundreds of domains. They are the perfect tools for    <br/>
creating test and development sites, hosting client websites or even managing<br/>
a full-blown online infrastructure for running a business.</p>

<p>Did we forget to mention, Webmin and Virtualmin are free* and open-source?   <br/>
Compared to site licensing costs of cPanel, WHM, Plesk and other proprietary <br/>
control panels, Webmin and Virtualmin cost only as much as a basic           <br/>
$10-20/month VPS account.</p>

<p>Bio: &#8212;&#8211; Christefano is CEO and Co-founder of Exaltation of Larks, where   <br/>
Virtualmin has been a key ingredient for rapid website deployment. He is a   <br/>
sysadmin for LA Drupal and the DrupalCamp LA website (which uses Virtualmin) <br/>
and has been on the Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org webmaster teams since   <br/>
2008. Exaltation of Larks, which provides Drupal consulting, development and <br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monthly meeting.</p>

<p>APRS is a amateur radio network where small packets of data such as position <br/>
reports, messages or telemetry are transmitted to other radio operators and  <br/>
eventually propagated to the Internet.                                       <br/>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System</p>

<p>The proliferation of small, low power and easily hackable ARM devices opens up
many possibilities for setting up unobtrusive computing solutions. Amateur   <br/>
radio operator and long time Linux user James McDuffie (K6JLM) explores using<br/>
the Seagate GoFlex Net along with surplus amateur radio equipment to build a <br/>
APRS digipeater for helping to relay packets both over RF and to the Internet.</p>

Decathlon will present their project, for which they are using various       <br/>
open-source technology.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Solar Decathlon is a U.S. Department of Energy Sponsored competition    <br/>
which challenges teams of college and graduate students from around the world<br/>
to design and build solar-powered, net-zero houses. Inside the SCI-Arc/Caltech
entry, code named CHIP, a sophisticated home automation system monitors every<br/>
watt of electricity consumed and visually communicates the information to    <br/>
homeowners. It also plays a central role in optimizing the behavior of the   <br/>
house at all times, such as by controlling operation of the active thermal   <br/>
mass, shutting down appliances or lights that are no longer used, and of     <br/>
course giving the homeowners an instant understanding into how their own     <br/>
behaviors affects their energy use and in turn their energy bill.&#8221;</p>
