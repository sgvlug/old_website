  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monthly meeting.</p>

<p>When you mention &#8220;running more than one operating system&#8221; on a computer, most<br/>
people will think &#8220;dual boot&#8221;, and for a wide variety of tasks that is quite <br/>
appropriate. But how many of you have thought of running more than one system<br/>
at the same time? Sure, you&#8217;re only &#8220;one person,&#8221; so why should the computer <br/>
act like you were two people doing different things?</p>

<p>Well, you might not want to reboot your machine &#8211; especially if you have a  <br/>
long-running task going on such as &#8220;seti at home&#8221; (since rebooting will cause<br/>
the &#8220;work unit&#8221; to be lost.) You might be a developer, and you&#8217;re working on <br/>
something intended to be &#8220;cross platform&#8221; &#8211; if every &#8220;rebuild-and-test&#8221; cycle
included &#8220;reboot the machine&#8221;, you&#8217;d tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you
have two programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to  <br/>
refer to the output of one program while working on the other.</p>

<p>If this describes you and you haven&#8217;t heard of VMware, then you need to attend
the February SGVLUG meeting. This month we&#8217;ll have Phil Anthony, a Sr. Systems
Engineer from VMware, here to talk about what VMware has to offer &#8211; he plans<br/>
to talk about the entier line &#8211; from the ESX server to the workstation to   <br/>
their newest offering, the &#8220;free&#8221; VMware player. (this is &#8220;free as in beer&#8221;, <br/>
folks&#8230;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monthly meeting.</p>

<p>CinePaint is an open source software application primarily used for motion   <br/>
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. Many films, such as Harry<br/>
Potter and Spider-Man, use CinePaint. It was used by Flash Film Works to add <br/>
flying arrows in The Last Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for <br/>
Best Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source application
in motion picture production.</p>

<p>CinePaint project leader Robin Rowe will talk about the new Glasgow          <br/>
architecture, what&#8217;s implemented, and what remains to be done. CinePaint     <br/>
Glasgow is scheduled for release on December 31, 2005. Glasgow runs on Linux,<br/>
Windows, and Mac OSX. Robin Rowe has led CinePaint since 2002. He&#8217;s the      <br/>
founder of LinuxMovies.org. He&#8217;s a partner in motion picture technology      <br/>
company MovieEditor.com.</p>
